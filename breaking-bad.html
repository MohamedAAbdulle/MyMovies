            <p>Because Breaking Bad didn’t just surprise its audience by showing that a meek, ostensibly upstanding high school teacher could, unbeknownst even to himself, actually be an amoral, self-gratifying criminal at heart. It also showed us that the reprobate, profanity-spouting high school dropout Walter White begrudgingly turns to could turn out to be capable of far grander accomplishments than anyone thought possible. And more importantly, it showed us that Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), the libertine, black sheep on the run from the law, would ultimately have the bigger, more sensitive heart than the middle-class father of two, providing the moral counter-reaction to all the humanity “Mister White” loses along the way.</p>
            <p>That too is a transition no one in the world of Breaking Bad saw coming. Early in the series, Walt admits that he never expected his young co-conspirator to amount to much. Walt keeps a constant eye on Jesse, especially at the outset of their scheme, regularly scolding his young partner for his ignorance and recklessness and aiming to bend Jesse to his needs at every turn. Walt may eventually come to view Jesse as a son, but at the start of their relationship, he sees Jesse as little more than a pain-in-the-ass, necessary evil — someone seemingly destined to burn out and fade away whenever Walt’s done with him.</p>
